# CalliopeGamePad

The CalliopeGamePad adds a gamepad to the Calliope Mini (https://calliope.cc/).
This project is a open source hardware project made with KiCAD 9 (https://www.kicad.org/).
It is intended to be 100% compatible with the CallioGamer of M. Klein @ https://www.hackster.io/MKlein/calliogamer-f57906 . Thanks goes to M. Klein for his wonderful project and his software @ https://github.com/MKleinSB/pxt-calliogamer.

Here are some differeneces compared to the CallioGamer:

* The CallioGamer production files seems to be broken at least for my PCB fab of choice. Now you have the freedom to adjust for yours as well.
* Added some additional mounting holes. So you can add a solid body to the board (e.g., cardboard or 3d-print)
* Optional Pull-Up resistors are available
* CalliopeGamePad is made in KiCAD (instead of EasyEDA)

You can remix the project and adjust as you like. Please visit the projects of M.Klein and have fun.

## Build your own

Almost all of the big PCB Fabs are able to handle .kicad_pcb files directly. Just upload and let them produce your Calliope Game Pad. In addition you find the gerber fabrication files in the `gerber` directory.
